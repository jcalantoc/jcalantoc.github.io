## Smart way of thinking 
In a software engineering class, we are taught to learn how to weigh in how choices effect the optimization of a solution to a given problem, as well as the tradeoffs of each option we have. It is important to incorporate this type of thinking into our learning routine, and it is crucial to learn how to think "Smart" when asking questions and learning from the feedback given.  The right questions can give the right answers that we can properly learn from.

## Not so Smart Question
[Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27413422/why-is-my-code-broken) is an example of a not so "Smart" question  on Stack overflow where a question is asked as to why code does not work, but it does not give enough context for anyone that might want to help.  There are no specifications in the desired outcome and what exactly has been done or looked up prior to coming across the problem.  One should be able to demonstrate their own attempts to solve the problem before asking a question.

## Smart Questions
On the other hand, [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12729122/angularjs-prevent-error-digest-already-in-progress-when-calling-scope-apply) is a "Smart" question where the problem in its specifics are listed as the heading of the thread, where more context on what is desired to be completed is also included.  On top of that, there is extra information on what the person might already know that could be confusing with the actual problem. This helps anyone else that reads the issue to assist in finding a proper solution for the specific needs.

## Going forward

It is crucial to learn this kind of perspective when asking questions. Just like when learning how to use google, learning how to ask questions when using valuable resources like Stack overfow optimizes the learning experience.  Asking questions enhance learning, and one should know how to get the most from asking questions.
