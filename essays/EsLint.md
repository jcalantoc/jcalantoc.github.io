## Strict, but productive

Learning Javascript with ESLint reminds me of my early Java days as a freshman being strictly graded on Checkstyle approved code.  I honestly enjoy having a standard for everything so that I am ensured my newly learned language code is readable, properly syntaxed, and easy for other experienced Javascript users to look at.  Most people might see it as just a big pain, and in a way it is, but remembering Checkstyle I feel helped me grow exponentially from learning Java as my first programming language. 

## VS Those Who Learned Differently

I have seen other people that learn Java without Checkstyle and I feel like they do not get used to indenting certain lines of code when using brackets in loops or conditionals; In some way this kind of learning without an inspection lets them think more about the actual concepts of coding instead, which is an important tradeoff to think off.  I honestly prefer learning any programming language with warnings just as a straight up preference.

## Overall Opinion

I do believe that ESLint is helpful, though I will acknowledge that recording when a space is at the end of my line seems a bit too strict, as I need to delete blank spaces a good amount lately.  Overall though, I stand with ESLint, and as we are to be disciplined Software Engineers in the making with this type of learning for Javascript, I look forward to all the experiences where I might struggle with getting all the green checkmarks in my code maintained.
