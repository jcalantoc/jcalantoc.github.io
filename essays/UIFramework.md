## What is the use?

UI frameworks such as Bootstrap 5 are utilized for the benefits of extra prebuilt customization in terms of icons/logos that you might put in a section of a website like a navigation bar, as well as buttons.  This type of easy accessibilitiy to visualized options allows for sped up testing and development of the front end of a website.

Moreover, the efficiency of developing with UI and its built in options to add to a website saves much time and costs in terms of designing something as simple as a cart logo for a shop's website.  As Bootstrap is open source, there are also people that support it and make sure it is properly available with standards that assure quality. 

## From an Engineering Perspective

In the disciplined mindset of Software Engineering, the open source and community backed aspects allow for standardized and approved ways of development.  Depending on the different frameworks used for different reasons, there are ways to specifically make small parts of developing a website easier to think about.  Many times it is nice to focus more about where on a website a component should go than how to implement it in the first place.  A feature of some UI Frameworks includes being able to support and add in Javascript components with styled components of their own.

## Overall Opinion

I personally enjoy using Bootstrap in the practice of replicating what websites look like, as it seems more impossible from a timely perspective to implement designs for a website without Bootstrap's built in icon search that allows for free usage of icons as well as the HTML for all of it. The combined creative opportunities and time saving aspect of Bootstrap are very desirable for a beginner developer like myself.
