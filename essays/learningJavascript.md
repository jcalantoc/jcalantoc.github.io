## Impressions on a new language 

As a student who has experience with a bit of C and C++ and is more familiarized with coding in Java, Javascript feels very comfortable where I feel like I am still programming in Java but with less restrictions in what I am allowed to do with functions with the idea of objects, though that is the learning curve so far that is very intriguing to learn to get the hang of.

Javascript has “first class” functions, and one is able to treat any functions as objects themselves, and flexibility is increased where they can be passed through as data to other functions or assign them to variables, assigning their references.  

In the perspective of software engineering, where we are learning to develop solutions to problems based on a given set of specific requirements or requests, and this new perspective of programming that Javascript gives me so far allows for the implementation of any dynamic creativity needed in this field of technology.  

So far so great. I enjoy the learning curve as well as the possibilities of capabilities Javascript seems to serve as it pertains to the idea of being a Software Engineer and skills I need to learn to be considered one.

## WODs

As we are learning how to practice and facilitate our Javascript learning process, WODs, or Workouts of the Day are a convenient way to get our reps in while learning this programming language as we would a simple exercise of push-ups or sit-ups.  

WODs are structured so that we are able to tackle problems on our own and efficiently and more effectively develop our problem solving skills given pressure that takes getting used to and a limited amount of time to force yourself to look for the tools we need for a solution

I always enjoy the pressure, as pressure will be a constant force we need to grow accustomed to going into any tech career, and I make sure to always push myself until the very end to try and find my own solution before looking at what solution is given.

WODs overall develop a healthy mindset for tackling stressful problems, as I learn to love learning even more, they are essential to my enjoyment of my early journey in Javascript and Software Engineering.
