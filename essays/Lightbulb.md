## Thrown in the Ocean


I went into college with little to no coding experience, and at the time I was anxious but excited to finally study a major that I picked and thought would be fun to learn.  Naturally, I learned and went through the struggles of learning code, and always wondered when the lightbulb would go off and I would be experienced enough to grasp most concepts.  One day the practice payed off and I was able to correlate the current learning material to all the past concepts I had been studying for so long. 


## Application

Currently I am always thrilled to think of new ways to consider how my coding skills can improve. I have started to learn javascript, and as I have been testing my knowledge in ICS 314, we have been discussing more questions regarding decisions of our code; we are taught to not only have our code be functional and complete a certain task, but we are taught to ask ourselves why we picked a specific way to code our functions. I am trying to be open to the idea of creativity regarding the fundamental tools we should know at this level, because we are taught to know the tradeoffs of coding.

## Creativity

I see software engineering as just creating a product or solution based on requirements given from a certain company. With our coding knowledge, I am interested in how we are able to bring different people's creative ideas to life. We are able to create applications that complete specific tasks, and we combine all of that with our problem solving skills.  Ultimately I just want to keep facilitating my problem solving skills to know how to approach a wider array of problems, so I am continuing to open my mind thorughout each lesson and struggle.
