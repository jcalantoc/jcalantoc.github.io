## A Plethora of Skills
In the Software Engineering class, it felt like a very brief but adequately balanced tour of all the aspects that a software engineer would need to develop oneself individually in the work field.  Everything from the big three of web development coding (HTML, CSS, JS) to frameworks, open source development, and ethics played a major role in solidifying what it meant to be a software engineer.  From foundational web development languages to advanced concepts, the course went beyond the creation of websites, emphasizing the cultivation of a mindset essential for problem-solving and continuous learning.


## Beyond Making Websites
 While web application development was a focal point, the class aimed at instilling fundamental software engineering concepts. Yes we did create apps in the form of websites in this class, but we learned more about how to think about code a certain way and how to carry out practices of learning, documenting, and reporting what happened when working toward a solution to a given problem. Software Engineering has to do with broader implications of the acquired knowledge, delving into key topics such as open source software development, configuration management, and functional programming.

## Control and Consistency
Configuration management emerged as a critical concept with universal significance, extending beyond web development. Configuration management has its pivotal role in maintaining the integrity of software systems. It emphasizes the importance of systematic control in ensuring the reliability and reproducibility of software projects, applicable across different domains.

## Blueprints for Success
The study of Design Patterns illuminated the importance of reusable solutions in software design, transcending the specificity of web applications. We discussed its universal applicability of design patterns, serving as blueprints for effective communication between developers and promoting best practices in software engineering, regardless of the project's nature.

## Versatility in Software Engineers
The Software Engineering class provided a comprehensive education that extended beyond web development, equipping students with skills applicable to diverse project landscapes. Lessons from Agile Project Management, Configuration Management, and Design Patterns exemplify the adaptability and transferability of software engineering concepts, preparing students to navigate the complexities of the evolving technological landscape.
