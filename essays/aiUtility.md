## Introduction
Generative AI that includes ChatGPT and other well known applications of it give plenty of insight on how one should provide quality testing and assurance that written software is of the right quality to deliver to users and companies demanding different products for their problems.  Because of the fundamental idea of AI being able to generate ideas, outlines, tutorials, or just brief overviews of concepts taught in classes such as in Software Engineering based on data fed to the AI models, one can utilize the power of AI to properly provide solutions and verify that those solutions are working and relevant to a given problem.

Throughout ICS 314, the software engineering class, the key with utilizing AI in my case included using ChatGPT to check where my current comprehension and application ability was in a current point in time, and compare that with what is being taught by professors' screencasts to make sure I am competent enough to proceed to the next level of learning how to develop websites or apps.


## Personal Experience with AI:
Components of the 314 course that I specifically utilized AI for include the in-class WODs, final project, pondering questions discussed in class, our final project, as well as learning concepts such as learning how to explain, document, and write specific code while assuring the quality of all my code that I would test and develop before submissions. 

For example during in-class WODs I would make sure to read the instructions, create a basic outline of how I would approach a problem in my head, then many times I would utilize ChatGPT to test against my own approach.  If I had a better approach to solving and implementing a WOD's problem, I would add more to the given code, but otherwise if my approach was at about the same level or lower understanding than what GPT provided, then I was fine checking if that code worked and then I just used what the AI gave me. This also applies to working on final project components that I needed to work on for my team, as well as properly stepping through how to start different sections of code.

Other portions of the class that I felt had a solid way for me to verify that I was learning or learning to implement code correctly while making good decisions in components of my code include experience WODs, essays, and asking the professor's or TA's specific questions.  Because of my trust in the knowledge of the higher-ups in this class, I take their information more seriously than the AI, because I am able to just test and work towards the results I wanted without needing to prompt some AI supplementation.  

An example I will take is the Experience WODs where professors will step us through a problem that we might have trouble doing the first time.  Because they are able to give a thorough explanation of a solution as well as show why it works, I do not need ChatGPT or other AI tools to supplement myself in these cases. On top of that, for Essay writing, unless I need specific understanding in a specific concept to write about, I am able to write essays on my own using the knowledge accumulated beforehand.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding
AI has given me a more structured and integrated way to implement different learning methods, especially in the field of computer science as it pertains to software engineering. In general, I go through classes just through notes, asking the professors and LA's and going over the material as much as possible in order to grasp each newly learned topic. However, since I started applying what I learn to ChatGPT AI prompts, I have a better way of correlating my own current knowledge and building off of that to keep a solid foundation of knowledge in everything I learn.  

Essentially, I always use AI to see where I might need to polish any details I missed when it comes to understanding concepts and why exactly we can and should apply them in different practical scenarios.  On top of that, often when starting a new course in college or on my own using the internet's resources, I ask for a specific learning outline for a couple of months given the concepts covered, that I may take from the syllabus or the overview of the course I am learning.

## Practical Applications
Regarding practical applications outside of college courses, any software projects big or small can be supported by the usage of AI and how competent or proficient a team is at prompting AI to solve problems and further develop code for a problem.  Any real-world problem can be looked at while at least checking or wondering what AI can contribute to the situation, and it is just a matter of what verification and proper checking is applied to the ideas AI can give.  In some way AI can be thought of as another way to just test how well something is going mattering if you can verify its correctness in answering a prompt.  

## Challenges and opportunities 
I believe the only challenging parts of working with AI include working with prompt answers that are generated when you are not so sure how to verify the answer with your own knowledge and resources.  At the beginning of the semester, I can say that AI prompts I gave for learning javascript implementation was very smooth and straightforward, but if I were to try to ask for a generation of a whole website, that would not be so easy as that would either require more intense detail and description of what I wanted the AI to give me.  Overall, if I got to the point where I was not able to get full, correct answers generated, I would have to work harder to prompt or work on my own and piece together a solution with only parts of the problem put into ChatGPT.

## Comparative Analysis
Between traditional teaching and AI-enhanced methods in software engineering education, AI is very insightful and and easy resource to have because while following along with an instructor or resource video etc, one is able to quickly ask AI similar questions and from there a different answer or approach of explaining can be created for students or learners to think about.  Because different approaches may work for different people, this gives a good way of having options when learning, and a fast way to asnwer certain questions.  

I personally believe that all types of traditional teaching methods cannot be hurt to use some sort of AI integration, so long that students are educated how to properly utilize it as a legitimate resource instead of just asking questions with the hope that they will obtain good scores on assignments and so forth.  Different types of guidelines must be made with all types of educational purposes that AI can help with.

## Future Considerations
The reason that AI in many people's eyes is not going to take over just yet has to do with the fact that models like GPT etc are not supplied with all the up to date information as of right now.  As we are able to feed more information into the models and advance their understanding of how to spit out answers to our prompts, we will need to keep track of how it can be used, what people are trying to use it for, and what we believe is beneficial for learning in general.  

For software engineering, it might be beneficial in the future to be able to make sure that those utilizing AI have a way to appropriately feed information, whether it be text, images, audio, or other appropriate documents, for the models to proficiently generate answers.  

## Conclusion
Collectively, AI is a gamechanging tool for convenience in more basic questions as well as giving a basic layout of what one's approach is for solving a problem or learning a specific concept in school. Specifically in software engineering, it is an extra resource (if properly used) to supplement quick and optimal learning in a subject. I will continue to utilize specifically ChatGPT in my future computer science endeavors going forth into more advance classes. As one who needs a structured outline at all times when completing tasks and a guide to help me better formulate my thinking processes, I am very much in favor of asking AI for its input on anything I do.
