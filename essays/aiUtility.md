## Introduction
Generative AI that includes ChatGPT and other well known applications of it give plenty of insight on how one should provide quality testing and assurance that written software is of the right quality to deliver to users and companies demanding different products for their problems.  Because of the fundamental idea of AI being able to generate ideas, outlines, tutorials, or just brief overviews of concepts taught in classes such as in Software Engineering, one can utilize the power of AI to properly provide solutions and verify that those solutions are working and relevant to a given problem.

Throughout ICS 314, the software engineering class, the key with utilizing AI in my case included using ChatGPT to check where my current comprehension and application ability was in a current point in time, and compare that with what is being taught by professors' screencasts to make sure I am competent enough to proceed to the next level of learning how to develop websites or apps.


## Personal Experience with AI:
Components of the 314 course that I specifically utilized AI for include the in-class WODs, final project, pondering questions discussed in class, our final project, as well as learning concepts such as learning how to explain, document, and write specific code while assuring the quality of all my code that I would test and develop before submissions. 

For example during in-class WODs I would make sure to read the instructions, create a basic outline of how I would approach a problem in my head, then many times I would utilize ChatGPT to test against my own approach.  If I had a better approach to solving and implementing a WOD's problem, I would add more to the given code, but otherwise if my approach was at about the same level or lower understanding than what GPT provided, then I was fine checking if that code worked and then I just used what the AI gave me. This also applies to working on final project components that I needed to work on for my team, as well as properly stepping through how to start different sections of code.

Other portions of the class that I felt had a solid way for me to verify that I was learning or learning to implement code correctly while making good decisions in components of my code include experience WODs, essays, and asking the professor's or TA's specific questions.  Because of my trust in the knowledge of the higher-ups in this class, I take their information more seriously than the AI, because I am able to just test and work towards the results I wanted without needing to prompt some AI supplementation.  

An example I will take is the Experience WODs where professors will step us through a problem that we might have trouble doing the first time.  Because they are able to give a thorough explanation of a solution as well as show why it works, I do not need ChatGPT or other AI tools to supplement myself in these cases. On top of that, for Essay writing, unless I need specific understanding in a specific concept to write about, I am able to write essays on my own using the knowledge accumulated beforehand.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding
AI has given me a more structured and integrated way to implement different learning methods, especially in the field of computer science as it pertains to software engineering. In general, I go through classes just through notes, asking the professors and LA's and going over the material as much as possible in order to grasp each newly learned topic. However, since I started applying what I learn to ChatGPT AI prompts, I have a better way of correlating my own current knowledge and building off of that to keep a solid foundation of knowledge in everything I learn.  

Essentially, I always use AI to see where I might need to polish any details I missed when it comes to understanding concepts and why exactly we can and should apply them in different practical scenarios.  On top of that, often when starting a new course in college or on my own using the internet's resources, I ask for a specific learning outline for a couple of months given the concepts covered, that I may take from the syllabus or the overview of the course I am learning.
