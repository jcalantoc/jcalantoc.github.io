<h2 id="a-plethora-of-skills">A Plethora of Skills</h2>
<p>In the Software Engineering class, it felt like a very brief but adequately balanced tour of all the aspects that a software engineer would need to develop oneself individually in the work field.  Everything from the big three of web development coding (HTML, CSS, JS) to frameworks, open source development, and ethics played a major role in solidifying what it meant to be a software engineer.  From foundational web development languages to advanced concepts, the course went beyond the creation of websites, emphasizing the cultivation of a mindset essential for problem-solving and continuous learning.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-making-websites">Beyond Making Websites</h2>
<p>While web application development was a focal point, the class aimed at instilling fundamental software engineering concepts. Yes we did create apps in the form of websites in this class, but we learned more about how to think about code a certain way and how to carry out practices of learning, documenting, and reporting what happened when working toward a solution to a given problem. Software Engineering has to do with broader implications of the acquired knowledge, delving into key topics such as open source software development, configuration management, and functional programming.</p>

<h2 id="control-and-consistency">Control and Consistency</h2>
<p>Configuration Management is a critical concept with universal significance, extending beyond web development. This systematic approach involves managing changes to a system’s performance, functionality, and attributes. Its role in ensuring the reliability and reproducibility of software projects cannot be overstated. Configuration Management serves as a linchpin, providing control and consistency, crucial not only in web development but also in diverse software endeavors. Whether dealing with embedded systems, enterprise-level applications, or other software projects, the principles of Configuration Management stand as safeguards against chaos, fostering a structured and dependable development process.  I learned to deal with issue driven configuration management which presented a list of issues that needed to be developed or addressed by a certain amount of time.  I got a basic gist of how to manage the development of an app this way, as it is practical and consistent mattering on the progress, but it is definitely beneficial if I learn other methods of configuration management and try to combine the methods.</p>

<h2 id="blueprints-for-success">Blueprints for Success</h2>
<p>The study of Design Patterns illuminated the importance of reusable solutions in software design, transcending the specificity of web applications. We discussed its universal applicability of design patterns, serving as blueprints for effective communication between developers and promoting best practices in software engineering, regardless of the project’s nature. Design Patterns are like architectural blueprints, providing a shared language for developers and promoting best practices. Regardless of the project’s nature—be it web-based systems or standalone desktop applications—the principles of Design Patterns serve as guiding lights, emphasizing code maintainability and scalability.  I felt this was helpful in keeping the frame of everything in our project consistent, but it would especially help in systems or applications where everything is built at a more massive scale.</p>

<h2 id="versatility-in-software-engineers">Versatility in Software Engineers</h2>
<p>The Software Engineering class provided a comprehensive education that extended beyond web development, equipping students with skills applicable to diverse project landscapes. Agile Project Management, Configuration Management, and Design Patterns exemplify the adaptability and transferability of software engineering concepts, facilitating complexities of the evolving technological landscape.  I have learned not only how a software engineer performs their duties, but also how they think, interpret problems, and deal with different types of issues with their practical experience. Although I have learned plenty in four months, everything is a work in progress, and I need to move forward to decide how to grow my acquired skills from here.</p>
