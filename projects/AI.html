<p>Being in this field of technology, we are encouraged to use generative AI, such as ChatGPT, if we feel we need their assistance throughout the class. However, we have to report on several factors, such as how we prompted the AI, how we determine if the answers given back are correct, and if we feel that any code given is effective or not. Other fields may be totally against the usage of a tool like this, but it is important to look into this type of AI as a tool that we can use correctly to facilitate learning and work speed, not as a search bar that just gives answers.</p>

<p>I am constantly gaining interest in analyzing how many of my peers might be utilizing the tool of generative AI and learning how to educate anyone on how one can use it as a proper resource, especially as it pertains to a computer science course like ICS 314- Software Engineering and any other tech class I take beyond that. Personally, I always try to make sure that I give thorough and detailed prompts that provide a specific scenario with the five W’s to the AI. I also like to vary prompts slightly to see how much of a change that brings to the table. It is important to note that, like most computers, the more specific scenarios/problems you prompt generative AI with, the more capable they are in terms of bringing up the exact information you may need. However, in terms of decisions that regard feelings or judgment of choices to a certain degree, AI currently may not be as capable as a human given the same prompt.</p>

<p>Going through each person’s style of prompting AI, I would like to see what kind of guidelines can be created to get the most out of each prompt a person can make. Different types of similar functions in code, to choices in why one choice in design might be better than another, and asking what exactly a certain coding concept is are ways we utilize AI, but we are still exploring the limits of the utility regarding these kinds of AI. The most fascinating thing I would like to differentiate is how different levels of tech users, such as freshmen vs seniors in computer science, or even other college majors entirely, prompt different generative AI tools. Going forward, I would like to log down the different progressions of how people start and learn to use AI in this way to assist them with any type of task, whether it be through college or life itself.</p>
