Being in ICS 314, we are encouraged to use generative AI such as ChatGPT if we feel we would need their assistance throughout the class, but we have to report on several factors such as how we prompted the AI, how we determine if the answer(s) given back are correct, and if we feel that any code given is that effective or not. It is important to look at this type of AI as tools that we can use correctly to facilitate learning and work speed, not a search bar that just gives answers.

I am interested in also analyzing how many of my peers might be utilizing the tool of generative AI, and learn how to educate anyone on how one can use it as a proper resource, especially as it pertains to a computer science course like ICS 314- Software Engineering.  Personally I always try to make sure that I give thorough and detailed prompts that give a specific scenario with the five W's to the AI.  I also like to very prompts slightly to see how much of a change that that brings to the table. 

Going through each person's style of prompting AI, I would like to see what kind of guidelines can be created in order to get the most out of each prompt a person can make.
